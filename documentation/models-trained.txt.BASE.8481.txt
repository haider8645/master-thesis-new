1)

The CAE without pooling layers is trained and tested

data type: hdf5
location: examples/master-thesis
Training time: almost 12 hours ( 6 pm to about 6 am)


2)

The conventional FC auto encoder in caffe examples is training as of writing this file

location: examples/mnist/
data type: LMDB
training time: going on, started at
Note: I used the AdaDelta solver, and there are in total 3 options. I do not know the difference
between these solvers but will see how they work in the near future in shaa Allah.


3) I have also trained a CAE-04

I have re-trained the CAE-02 with batch size of 50 and max iterations at 50000.

08/02/2018

I have trained CAE-04 and CAE-30 and saw their visualization, they work as expected
