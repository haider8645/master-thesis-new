For 22/01/2018

1) See the caffe.proto file in caffe_root/src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto
The above file has the definitions for all the layers, maybe it is has
the syntax too, will be good to know this.

2) Start working on the visualization of the trained caffe model either in python or matlab.

3) Look into the paper of the CAE w/o pooling layers and see how they make sure that
the training parameters are the same in both encoder & decoder part.



24/01/2018

1) The visualization using the python wrapper was done. Still need to do the scatter plot either in matlab or python.


25/01/2018

1) Trying the scatter plot in matlab or python
2) make the hdf5 format dataset for the waste material images.

27/01/2018
made the hdf5 dataset for trashnet dataset

28/01/2018
change the cae model to work with 512 x 384 size images

03/02/2018
Work on the T-SNE for 4 - CAE model plot in 2D

08/02/2018
Start working on the trashnet. Convert the picture into smaller images and design a CAE model that is large enough to extract all information of different trash materials


17/02/2018
Get clustering results for trashnet before 27/02/2018


03/03/2018
Still do not have clustering results of trashnet.. Will try the same network on a dataset today that has just a single channel
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

04/03/2018
After finish the training, add a FC layer in the middle to do clustering
