#12-05-2018: -> earlyfusion: trained with respectable results, snapshot in snapshots-train-4-conv4-earlyfusion
#12-05-2018: -> update-12-05-2018: removed conv4, deconv4 , made encoder, decoder symmertic, encoder fc1 has 450 units, decoder fc2 has 100(350 units differnce but maybe its not important)
                but the error is not decreasing, change lr to 0.001, changed adam to sgd, weight decay to 0.001 and no use
#12-05-2018: -> taking loss w.r.t original data and not normalized data
#13-05-2018: -> model with earlyfusion and respectable results is in the folder attempt 2
#13-05-2018: -> model with fused but poor results with no norm scale is in attempt 1 folder
#13-05-2018: -> model with many changes as in training file and still aweful results in folder 3
#13-05-2018  -> testing the network with 4 conv layers but massive network!
